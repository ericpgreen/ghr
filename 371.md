### Course Description

This course will introduce you to research designs and methods in global health. Global health is a multi-disciplinary field, so we will consider approaches common to the behavioral and social sciences, public health, and medicine.

Our primary interest will be the study of causal inference. In global health, we are often interested in knowing what treatments, programs, interventions, and policies "work" and why. To answer questions of impact, we often turn to randomized controlled trials, a mainstay of medical research. As such, we will spend time exploring the rationale, process, and limitations of field experiments.

Randomization is not always possible or advisable, however, and researchers must build a causal argument using non-experimental methods. We will review several approaches, consider relevant threats to causal inference, and discuss how to improve non-experimental research designs.

As we build up to this discussion, we will cover research basics, such as asking evidence-based research questions, searching the literature, developing a theory of change, identifying indicators and collecting data, selecting research participants, and testing hypotheses. In the latter part of the course, we will turn to more specialized topics in global health research, such as writing research proposals and manuscripts, economic analyses, and making an impact.

### Learning Objectives

We have two broad goals this semester:

* to make you a better consumer of research, and
* to prepare you to contribute to research teams at Duke and beyond.

Each module has specific learning objectives to help you achieve these overall goals. You can download a complete list of objectives [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c-2JyT2oJy2rQUhkKR6qJsuiCbuNkXvaFxT5RN4aqFo/pub?gid=1261231891&single=true&output=pdf).

### Class Format

This course will incorporate pedagogical concepts and strategies from "flipped" classrooms. Students must prepare for class sessions by reading, watching videos, and completing short assignments. **Click on the session links on the schedule to understand the expectations for each session.** Pre-class assignments and in-class readiness assessments (announced or unannounced; individual or small group) may count toward your course grade.

Class sessions may begin with a brief lecture designed to reinforce or extend pre-class learning, but the aim is to spend most of the in-class time on application activities. The balance of in-class lecture vs. application activity may shift throughtout the semester.

### Course Requirements

The main course text is "Global Health Research: Designs and Methods". You can access it through the "Book" link in the menu bar. This on-line book includes videos that are required viewing.

You'll also be reading journal articles that will be available through Sakai or the Duke Library. You do not need to pay for any articles. If you are struggling to access a resource, consult with a librarian or ask for help on Piazza.

### Workload

A reasonable rule of thumb is somewhere between 2:1 and 3:1 out-of-class to in-class hours. We'll meet in class 150 minutes each week, so expect somewhere between 5 to 7.5 hours outside of class. If you find yourself putting in more hours than the upper end of this estimate, come see me. It's quite possible that you are not using your time as efficiently as you could.

### Evaluation

Your final grade will be a weighted average of several components: Individual Readiness Assessments, Team Readiness Assessments, peer evaluation, pre-class preparation, application activities, homework, a midterm exam, and a final exam.

| Component                             | Weight |
|----                                   |:--:    |
| Pre-class preparation                 | 10%    |
| Application activities                | 20%    |
| Homework                              | 20%    |
| Midterm                               | 25%    |
| Final                                 | 25%    |

Ranges for letter grades will be set at the end of the semester, and grades may be curved. Cumulative scores of at least 90, 80, and 70 will be guaranteed at least an A-, B-, and C-, respectively. 

### Getting Help

Getting help is easy. Try the following, in order of priority:

1. Ask a question in class.
2. Post a question to Piazza. This is a great platform that turns your questions and answers into public goods. We'll strive to answer every question within hours (often minutes). You can post anonymously to your peers if desired, so there really are no "dumb" questions.
3. If you need additional help after trying #1 and #2, attend office hours or set up individual or small-group meetings. 

Please limit your emails to personal matters that are not appropriate for class or Piazza. "I don't understand power calculations" is not a personal matter. Emails like this will probably go unanswered, whereas Piazza messages will be rewarded with snappy replies since they benefit everyone.

### Policies

Please note the following:

* There will be **no make-ups** for readiness assessments or exams.
	* The **final exam** is scheduled for **Tuesday, May 2 from 7-10pm ET**. You must take the final exam to pass the class. There will be no make-ups, so it is your responsibility to put this time on your calendar and ensure that you are available. This exam will be cumulative and cover all readings, videos, activities, and homework.
	* If you miss the **midterm exam**, the final exam will count for 50% of your grade.
	* If you are absent on a day that students complete a **readiness assessment** in class, you will receive a 0 for that assessment.
* If you miss an in-class **application activity**, you will have 72 hours to submit your completed work. After 72 hours, you will receive a score of 0 unless you have permission to follow a different schedule. [See here](https://trinity.duke.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies/class-attendance-and-missed-work) for more details about Duke's policies regarding class attendance and missed work.
* **Homework** will be due at 10am on the date indicated on the schedule. Late submissions will penalized 5 percentage points. For every 24 hours late after the missed deadline, an additional 5 percentage points will be deducted from the score. **Homework should be completed individually and not discussed with anyone else.**
* Students should abide by the [Duke Community Standard](https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct/about-us/duke-community-standard) at all times. If a questionable circumstance arises, do not hesitate to seek my guidance (before is always better than after).
* Any student with a documented disability needing academic adjustments or accommodations should speak with me during the first two weeks of class. All discussions will remain confidential. Students with disabilities will also need to contact the [Student Disability Access Office](http://www.access.duke.edu/students/requesting/index.php).
