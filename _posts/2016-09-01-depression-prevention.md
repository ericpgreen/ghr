title: "They also need to consider whether the approach is something that can be implemented in the real world"
---

The Cochrane Library of systematic reviews is featuring an update to a review last updated in 2011 titled ["Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), third-wave CBT and interpersonal therapy (IPT) based interventions for preventing depression in children and adolescents"](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD003380.pub4/full). The evidence does not look good for depression prevention, especially "universal" prevention. 

The review authors—Hetrick et al. (2016)—conclude that "[future studies] also need to consider whether [depression prevention] is something that can be implemented in the real world." It's not every day that you read research that points to the importance of making sure that interventions are designed with implementation and scale in mind. Certainly not in the psych literature!
