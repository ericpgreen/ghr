title: New website!
---

Thanks in part to a grant from <a href="https://online.duke.edu/">OnlineDuke</a> and the <a href="https://globalhealth.duke.edu">Duke Global Health Institute</a>, I'm creating this site to host all of my course material for Global Health Research Designs and Methods. My goal is to have the site functional for the Fall 2016 section of GLHLTH 702.
