[This workshop](http://www.globalhealthresearch.co/workshops/datascience/schedule/) is designed to help students learn modern data science workflows using R and RStudio. We'll focus on how to import, tidy, transform, and visualize data in preparation for analysis. We'll also cover how to create reproducible reports and Shiny apps based on your data. There are no prerequisites.
