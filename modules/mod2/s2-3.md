### In-Class Activities

*Get together two other members of your team. One person should make a copy of the response template and share it with the others and with the teaching team. Follow the instructions in the template and on this page.*

#### Practice 

1. Poor and incomplete reporting in health research is a common problem that limits our ability as readers to assess claims and integrate findings into systematic reviews and meta-analyses. To help solve this problem, many journal editors are now requiring you to show evidence that you followed standard reporting requirements for your research design. A good resource for these guidelines is the [Equator Network](http://www.equator-network.org/). Visit this website and identify the guidelines that you should consult when preparing a study protocol.

2. Next, follow the link to the CONSORT guidelines for trials, or just click [here](http://www.consort-statement.org/). There you can download checklists and templates for the CONSORT guidelines. Step through [this example](http://www.consort-statement.org/checklists/view/651-cluster-trials/846-title) to get a quick explanation of all 25 checklist items for cluster trials.

3. Especially when you are just starting out, it can be very helpful to evaluate an article or manuscript by using the appropriate checklist and searching for key details. You'll do this for the Deribew et al. (2012) article that you read for today.

4. There are many tools to help you walk through the process of critical appraisal. For example, see [these worksheets](http://guides.mclibrary.duke.edu/ebm/appraise) from Duke Med. For this exercise, we'll use Cochrane's [Risk of Bias Tool (RoB)](http://handbook.cochrane.org/chapter_8/8_assessing_risk_of_bias_in_included_studies.htm). This tool is typically used in the context of preparing a systematic review, but we can use it to evaluate Deribew et al. (2012). Follow the instructions on the template. [*Note: The RoB tool is designed for randomized trials. When you need to evaluate a non-randomized study, see [here](http://handbook.cochrane.org/chapter_13/13_5_assessing_risk_of_bias_in_non_randomized_studies.htm) for comments and check out the [ROBINS-I](https://sites.google.com/site/riskofbiastool/home) tool.*]

5. The RoB tool asks you to indicate [your judgement about each type of potential bias](http://handbook.cochrane.org/chapter_8/table_8_5_d_criteria_for_judging_risk_of_bias_in_the_risk_of.htm) and document [support for this judgement](http://handbook.cochrane.org/chapter_8/table_8_5_c_examples_of_summary_descriptions_for_sequence.htm). See the links for examples of each.

6. So far we've focused on assessing the quality of individual *studies*, but we can extend this discussion to the evaluation of individual *outcomes* (e.g., bed net utilization) estimated across multiple studies. Cochrane reviews use the [GRADE approach](http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/) to define the quality of a body of evidence for individual outcomes. GRADE has four levels: high, moderate, low, and very low. Outcomes from randomized trials start out "high" and can be downgraded based on risk of potential bias. Outcomes from observational studies start out "low" and can be upgraded if certain conditions are met. "High" quality evidence signifies that further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of the effect. For an example of how GRADE is reported, see [this review](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009186.pub2/pdf) by Polec et al. (2015) that includes Deribew et al. (2012).

7. **Not required**: For help creating your own summary table like Polec et al. (2015), see a web-based program called [GradePro](http://gdt.guidelinedevelopment.org/app/#).
