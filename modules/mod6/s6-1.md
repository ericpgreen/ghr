### About this Module

Experiments are the "gold standard" in the eyes of many people, but researchers are not always able to assign people or clusters to conditions or otherwise manipulate an independent variable. In these cases, researchers must rely on non-experimental designs. The goal of this module is to introduce you to two classes of non-experimental research: quasi-experimental and observational designs.
