### About this Session

In this session you will learn about two underutilized tools in the quasi-experimental toolbox: regression discontinuity and interrupted time series.

### In-Class Activity
<p></p>

#### A. Does vaccination for HPV increase risky sexual behavior?

Smith et al. (2015) used regression discontinuity to estimate the impact of Ontario's grade 8 HPV vaccination program on sexual behavior. Use what you've learned so far to identify the key details about the research design and methods.

#### B. Does improving access to healthcare decrease hospitalizations?

Rashidian et al. (2013) used an interrupted time series design to estimate the effect of a rural healthcare reform on hospitalization rates. How did the authors take advantage of routinely collected health system data to answer this question?
