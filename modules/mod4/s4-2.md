### About this Session

In this session you will learn how to operationalize study constructs and identify indicators for each part of a hypothesized causal chain.

### In-Class Activities

*Get back together with your team members from Session 3.3. Open the response template you started and follow the instructions on this page.*

| **Pre-class prep** | Read Patil et al. (2014). The effect of India's Total Sanitation Campaign on Defecation Behaviors and Child Health in Rural Madhya Pradesh: A cluster randomized controlled trial. [*PLOS Medicine, 11(8), 1-17*](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bxn_jkXZ1lxub0xMNGJaVXNxZk0). Focus on the Introduction and Methods.|
| **Materials**       | Use document you began editing in Session 3.3 |
| **Submission**     | Share with `designsandmethods@` if you have not done so already |

<p></p>

#### Part 1. Revisit Patil et al. (2014)

Create a 4-column table:

1. list each outcome (and inferred impacts) in Patil et al.
2. record how Patil et al. defined each indicator (be specific)
3. determine if the indicator maps onto any indicators in the [WHO Global Reference List of 100 Core Health Indicators](http://www.who.int/healthinfo/indicators/2015/en/)
4. determine if the indicator maps onto any [Sustainable Development Goals](http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/)

#### Part 2. Develop your theory of change into a logic model

Next, return to the theory of change you developed in Session 3.3 and transform it into a logic model. Create a separate table that defines each indicator.

#### Part 3. Share your work

1. When prompted, please share your work with another team. They will share with you. Do not discuss anything with the team when sharing.

2. Review the other team's theory of change, logic model, and indicator definitions. Document your ideas for improvement. You might be ask to present your colleagues' work—and your critique—at the end of class.
