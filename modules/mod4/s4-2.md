### About this Session

In this session you will learn how to operationalize study constructs and identify indicators for each part of a hypothesized causal chain.

### Session Learning Objectives

### In-Class Activities

*Get back together with your team members from Session 3.3. Open the response template you started and follow the instructions on this page.*

| **Pre-class prep** | Read Patil et al. (2014). The effect of India's Total Sanitation Campaign on Defecation Behaviors and Child Health in Rural Madhya Pradesh: A cluster randomized controlled trial. [*PLOS Medicine, 11(8), 1-17*](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bxn_jkXZ1lxub0xMNGJaVXNxZk0). Focus on the Introduction and Methods.|
| **Materials**       | Use document you began editing in Session 3.3 |
| **Submission**     | Share with `designsandmethods@` if you have not done so already |

<p></p>

#### Part 1. List and define outcomes from Patil et al. (2014) and attempt to link Patil's outcomes to global indicators

1. Create a 4-column table and list each outcome (and inferred impacts) in Patil et al.
2. Record how Patil et al. defined each indicator (be specific)
3. Determine if the indicator maps onto any indicators in the [WHO Global Reference List of 100 Core Health Indicators](http://www.who.int/healthinfo/indicators/2015/en/)
4. Determine if the indicator maps onto any [Sustainable Development Goals](http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/)

*For #3 and #4, describe the global indicator if one exists**

<p></p>

#### Part 2. Develop your theory of change into a logic model

1. Return to the theory of change you developed in Session 3.3 for your new intervention (not Patil et al.) and transform it into a logic model. 
2. Create a 2-column table that defines each indicator.
