### About this Module

The goal of this module is to introduce you to global health indicators and methods of data collection. Indicators are observable measures of study constructs. Part of developing a good logic model is identifying indicators for each part of the hypothesized causal chain. Once you know what indicators you want to measure, you must decide *how* to measure them. Sometimes it's possible to use existing data sources, such as administrative or medical records, but most likely part or all of your data will come from original data collection efforts. We'll review common quantitative and qualitative methods that you can use.
