### About this Session

In this session you will learn how to determine the optimal sample size given different study objectives and constraints.

*Get together with two other members of your team. One person should make a copy of the response template and share it with the others and with the teaching team. Follow the instructions in the template and on this page.*

You and your partners have been asked to conduct a randomized controlled trial of a new [behavior change communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_change_communication) (BCC) program designed to increase the use of insecticide treated nets (ITN) for children under 5 years of age living on the shores of Lake Victoria, a malaria endemic region in Kenya. The NGO's new BCC program involves having a drama troupe visit villages on multiple occasions and perform a series of outdoor plays about the importance of ITN use and malaria prevention.

The donor funding the BCC program set aside $85,000 for a rigorous evaluation, and the program officer wants to know the smallest effect that you could detect in the trial. To answer this question, you need to know the starting pointâ€”the prevalence of bed net use without the new BCC program. Then you can use [this power calculator](https://egap.shinyapps.io/Power_Calculator/) and this [budget template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RVraM9w47fyzAQ3CaXGQokTUye8ueYuxnaOleU7W8tI/edit?usp=sharing) to determine the smallest effect (binary, difference of proportions) you can detect with 80% power. [note: only type in the yellow cells for the budget]

The non-governmental organization (NGO) that will implement the BCC program operates in Kisumu County. They've contracted your team to complete a baseline survey in no more than 20 days. Your first deliverable is a brief implementation plan that addresses issues related to power and sample size.
