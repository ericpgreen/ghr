### In-Class Activities

We'll review Kohrt et al. (2011) with the goal of understanding why instrument validation is important and how careful work prior to validation can make an instrument culturally- and contextually-relevant.

Then we'll turn to an example from my work in Kenya on perinatal depression. I'll describe the formative study that we completed to come up with a set of 60 items that we used to assess perinatal depression among a sample of pregnant women and new mothers. You'll use the results of this study to calculate the metrics we use to evaluate criterion validityâ€”does the new scale we developed accurately measure this thing called depression?
