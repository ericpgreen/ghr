### About this Session

In this session you will learn how to recruit a study sample. There are two general approaches to sampling: probability and non-probability sampling. The main difference is that in a probability sample, every unit (e.g., person) in the population has a knowable, non-zero probability of selection. Most research in global health does NOT use probability sampling. There's a good chance that you won't either, unless you're trying to accurately estimate some characteristic of the population. For instance, you want to estimate the prevalence of malaria among pregnant women in Thailand. To get an unbiased answer to this question, you'll need a probability sample. These types of epidemiological/descriptive questions are critical, of course, but most research examines the relationships between variables rather than prevalence, and probability samples are not essential.
