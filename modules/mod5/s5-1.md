### About this Module

Now that you have a good, evidence-based research question and a primary outcome that you can define and measure, you are ready to think about the subjects of your research. Most often your research subjects—participants—will be people or places. You have two basic questions to answer about these participants: 

1. How will you find, recruit, and select them? (sampling)
2. How many do you need to include to meet your study objectives? (power)

The goal of this module is to help you think through these two questions.
