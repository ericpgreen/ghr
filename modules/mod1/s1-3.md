### About this Session

In this session we will introduce you to two data management and analysis tools that you will use extensively in global health research. The goal is to make you ready to use these tools in course tutorials this semester and to spark an interest so that you return later to learn more.

R is a powerful statistical programming language that is free and open source. This means that you and your colleagues—wherever they are in the world—will always be able to use the latest version of R and customize it to fit your needs. If you see a future for yourself in data science more generally, [you need to know R](http://www.kdnuggets.com/2015/05/r-vs-python-data-science.html). There is a [large community of R users](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r) with a lot of wisdom to share.

Excel is a fantastic tool for project management. Some people get a long way in Excel for data analysis, but [I don't recommend it](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/04/16/is-the-best-evidence-for-austerity-based-on-an-excel-spreadsheet-error/?utm_term=.71ce013f966a). Programs like R, Stata, Python, and SAS are much better options for analysis because they enable you to create [reproducible analyses](https://www.coursera.org/learn/reproducible-research). Still, I can say with 100% certainty that you will use Excel for some task in your first global health job. My experience is that students come to these entry level jobs not knowing enough about Excel. I want to change this. Excel is closed, proprietary software from Microsoft, but it is ubiquitous. There is [a free, open source alternative](https://www.openoffice.org/), but most offices rely on Excel, so this is what I'll have you demo in class.

**Q**: I already know how to use R and Excel.

**A**: Great! Please help the person next to you.
