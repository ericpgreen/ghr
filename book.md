Malaria kills more than 500,000 people each year. Mostly African kids. The worst part is that malaria is preventable and treatable. Insecticide treated bednets prevent transmission, but coverage and use is too low in many places. Should nets be given away for free or subsidized? Is this even sustainable? These are critical questions for scholars, practitioners, policymakers, and donors. Researchers are working hard to get solid answers, and this book will introduce you to their methods.

> Creating the cover for this book, I wanted to create imagery that reflected the “action” of research in Global Health. Rather than depict a portrait of impoverished villages, a nebulous globe, or still life of medicine- I created a representation of the data that drives the change. I was inspired by the bubble charts of Hans Rosling and the aesthetic philosophy of Wassily Kandinsky. For both, “shape” was an important tool for expression. In creating the constellation of circles I was able to convey a dynamic representation for a larger living idea.
