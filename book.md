> Creating the cover for this book, I wanted to create imagery that reflected the “action” of research in Global Health. Rather than depict a portrait of impoverished villages, a nebulous globe, or still life of medicine- I created a representation of the data that drives the change. I was inspired by the bubble charts of Hans Rosling and the aesthetic philosophy of Wassily Kandinsky. For both, “shape” was an important tool for expression. In creating the constellation of circles I was able to convey a dynamic representation for a larger living idea.
