<i>Global Health Research: Data Science</i> is a hands-on guide for global health students without much experience in modern data workflows. Readers will learn how to use R and RStudio to import, tidy, transform, and visualize data in preparation for analysis, and then create reproducible reports and Shiny apps to share findings. This book is designed to take readers from raw data to publication-quality manuscripts.

These books are works in progress. If you find errors (gasp!), please create an issue on Github ([GHR](https://github.com/ericpgreen/GHRbook) or [GHDS](https://github.com/ericpgreen/GHDS)), [email me](eric.green@duke.edu), or shame me on Twitter (`@ericpgreen`). I'm writing the books in [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) within [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/). The [`bookdown`](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) package from the makers of RStudio does most of the heavy lifting to compile the book. The source code for the books is available on Github ([GHR](https://github.com/ericpgreen/GHRbook) and [GHDS](https://github.com/ericpgreen/GHDS)).
