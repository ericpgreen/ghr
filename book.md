Malaria kills more than 500,000 people each year. Mostly African kids. The worst part is that malaria is preventable and treatable. Insecticide treated bednets prevent transmission, but coverage and use is too low in many places. Should nets be given away for free or subsidized? Is this even sustainable? These are critical questions for scholars, practitioners, policymakers, and donors. Researchers are working hard to get solid answers, and this book will introduce you to their methods.
