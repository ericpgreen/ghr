### Course Description

This course will introduce you to research designs and methods in global health. Global health is a multi-disciplinary field, so we will consider approaches common to the behavioral and social sciences, public health, and medicine.

Our primary interest will be the study of causal inference. In global health, we are often interested in knowing what programs and interventions "work" and why. To answer questions of impact, we often turn to randomized controlled trials, a mainstay of medical research. As such, we will spend a good amount of time understanding the rationale, process, and limitations of field experiments.

Randomization is not always possible or advisable, however, and researchers must build a causal argument using non-experimental methods. We will review several approaches, consider relevant threats to causal inference, and discuss how to improve non-experimental research designs.

As we build up to this discussion, we will cover research basics, such as developing and testing theory, asking good questions, understanding variability, designing good measurement, and selecting research participants. In the latter part of the course, we will turn to more specialized topics in global health research, such as writing manuscripts, sharing your work, and making an impact.

### Learning Objectives

We have two broad goals this semester:

* to make you a better consumer of research, and
* to prepare you to contribute to research teams at Duke and beyond.

Each session has specific learning objectives to help you achieve these overall goals. You can download a complete list of objectives [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c-2JyT2oJy2rQUhkKR6qJsuiCbuNkXvaFxT5RN4aqFo/pub?gid=1261231891&single=true&output=pdf).

### Class Format

This course will incorporate pedagogical concepts and strategies from "flipped" classrooms and team based learning. After the first class, you will be assigned to a team of 6 to 7 students. You and your team will work together on in-class assignments.

You will be asked to prepare for class by reading assigned text and watching video lectures. At the beginning of each module you will complete a short assessment that is designed to evaluate your understanding of this material (closed book, closed notes). Each assessment will consist of 10 multiple choice or short answer questions and last 10-15 minutes.

Following these Individual Readiness Assessments (IRAs), you and your team will complete the same assessment together as a team (Team Readiness Assessment, TRA). We will then discuss answers as a group, and I may present additional material in class to clarify concepts. 

After the overview session, the remaining sessions in the module will focus on applied problem solving through team-based Application Activities (AA). You should prepare for these activities by reviewing the session info page that can be found in the schedule. There will often be additional assigned reading that you should complete BEFORE class to be ready for the activity. We'll start AA sessions with a mini-lecture and a clicker quiz about the activity.

### Course Requirements

You will need to bring an iClicker2 device to every class to participate in assessments and in-class activities.

The main course text is "Global Health Research: Designs and Methods". You can access it through the "Book" link in the menu bar. This on-line book includes videos that are required viewing.

You'll also be reading journal articles that will be available through Sakai or the Duke Library. You do not need to pay for any articles. If you are struggling to access a resource, consult with a librarian or ask for help on Piazza.

### Workload

A reasonable rule of thumb is somewhere between 2:1 and 3:1 out-of-class to in-class hours. We'll meet in class 150 minutes each week, so expect somewhere between 5 to 7.5 hours outside of class. If you find yourself putting in more hours than the upper end of this estimate, come see me. It's quite possible that you are not using your time as efficiently as you could.

### Evaluation

Your final grade will be a weighted average of several components: Individual Readiness Assessments, Team Readiness Assessments, peer evaluation, pre-class preparation, application activities, homework, a midterm exam, and a final exam.

| Component                             | Weight |
|----                                   |:--:    |
| Individual readiness assessments      | 5%     |
| Team readiness assessments            | 5%     |
| Peer evaluation                       | 5%     |
| Pre-class preparation                 | 5%     |
| Application activities                | 10%    |
| Homework                              | 20%    |
| Midterm                               | 25%    |
| Final                                 | 25%    |

Ranges for letter grades will be set at the end of the semester, and grades may be curved. Cumulative scores of at least 90, 80, and 70 will be guaranteed at least an A-, B-, and C-, respectively. 

### Getting Help

Getting help is easy. Try the following, in order of priority:

1. Ask a question in class.
2. Post a question to Piazza. This is a great platform that turns your questions and answers into public goods. We'll strive to answer every question within hours (often minutes). You can post anonymously to your peers if desired, so there really are no "dumb" questions.
3. If you need additional help after trying #1 and #2, attend office hours or set up individual or small-group meetings. 

Please limit your emails to personal matters that are not appropriate for class or Piazza. "I don't understand power calculations" is not a personal matter. Emails like this will probably go unanswered, whereas Piazza messages will be rewarded with snappy replies since they benefit everyone.

### Policies

Please note the following:

* There will be **no make-ups** for readiness assessments or exams.
	* The **final exam** is scheduled for **Monday, December 19 from 2-5:00pm ET**. You will be expected to be available during this time, but you do NOT need to be on campus. You must take the final exam to pass the class. There will be no make-ups, so it is your responsibility to put this time on your calendar and ensure that you are available. This exam will be cumulative and cover all readings, videos, activities, and homework.
	* If you miss the **midterm exam**, the final exam will count for 50% of your grade.
	* You will take 7 **readiness assessments**. Missed assessments will result in a score of 0. There will not be an opportunity to make up these assessments (even if the absence in excused). Instead, your lowest score will be dropped.
* If you miss an **application activity**, you will have 72 hours to submit your completed work. After 72 hours, you will receive a score of 0 unless you have permission to follow a different schedule. [See here](https://trinity.duke.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies/class-attendance-and-missed-work) for more details about Duke's policies regarding class attendance and missed work.
* **Homework** will be due at 1pm ET on the date indicated on the schedule. Late submissions will penalized 5 percentage points. For every 24 hours late after the missed deadline, an additional 5 percentage points will be deducted from the score. **Homework should be completed individually and not discussed with anyone else.**
* Students should abide by the [Duke Community Standard](https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct/about-us/duke-community-standard) at all times. If a questionable circumstance arises, do not hesitate to seek my guidance (before is always better than after).
* Any student with a documented disability needing academic adjustments or accommodations should speak with me during the first two weeks of class. All discussions will remain confidential. Students with disabilities will also need to contact the [Student Disability Access Office](http://www.access.duke.edu/students/requesting/index.php).
