### Course Description

This course will introduce you to research designs and methods in global health. Global health is a multi-disciplinary field, so we will consider approaches common to the behavioral and social sciences, public health, and medicine.

Our primary interest will be the study of causal inference. In global health, we are often interested in knowing what programs and interventions "work" and why. To answer questions of impact, we often turn to randomized controlled trials, a mainstay of medical research. As such, we will spend a good amount of time understanding the rationale, process, and limitations of field experiments.

Randomization is not always possible or advisable, however, and researchers must build a causal argument using non-experimental methods. We will review several approaches, consider relevant threats to causal inference, and discuss how to improve non-experimental research designs.

As we build up to this discussion, we will cover research basics, such as developing and testing theory, asking good questions, understanding variability, designing good measurement, and selecting research participants. In the latter part of the course, we will turn to more specialized topics in global health research, such as writing manuscripts, sharing your work, and making an impact.

### Learning Objectives

We have two broad goals this semester:

* to make you a better consumer of research, and
* to prepare you to contribute to research teams at Duke and beyond.

Each session has specific learning objectives to help you achieve these overall goals. You can download a complete list of objectives [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c-2JyT2oJy2rQUhkKR6qJsuiCbuNkXvaFxT5RN4aqFo/pub?gid=1261231891&single=true&output=pdf).

### Class Format

This course will incorporate pedagogical concepts and strategies from "flipped" classrooms and team based learning. After the first class, you will be assigned to a team of 4 to 6 students. You and your team will work together on in-class assignments.

You will be asked to prepare for class by completing assignments and reviewing video lectures. At the beginning of each module you will complete a short assessment based on the assigned readings and lectures (closed book, closed notes). Each assessment will consist of 10 multiple choice or short answer questions and last 10-15 minutes.

Following these Individual Readiness Assessments (IRAs), you and your team will complete the same assessment together as a team. We will then discuss answers as a group, and I may present additional material in class to clarify concepts. Class time will often be used to solve applied problems in teams.

Students needing additional help understanding the material will be encouraged to attend office hours or set up individual or small-group meetings.

### Course Requirements

You will need to bring an iClicker2 device to every class to participate in assessments and in-class activities. You will also need to share the cost of printing a conference poster ($45 from PhD Posters) with 2 to 3 other students.

The main course text is "Global Health Research: Designs and Methods". You can access it through the "Book" link in the menu bar. This on-line book includes videos that are required viewing.

You'll also be reading journal articles that will be available through Sakai or the Duke Library. You do not need to pay for any articles. If you are struggling to access a resource, consult with a librarian or ask for help on Piazza.

### Grading


### Workload

A reasonable rule of thumb is somewhere between 2:1 and 3:1 out-of-class to in-class hours. We meet in class 150 minutes each week, so expect somewhere between 5 to 7.5 hours outside of class. If you find yourself putting in a lot more hours than the upper end of this estimate, come see me. It's quite possible that you are not using your time as efficiently as you could.

### Policies

* Students should abide by the Duke Community Standard at all times. If a questionable circumstance arises, do not hesitate to seek my guidance (before is always better than after).

* Any student with a documented disability needing academic adjustments or accommodations should speak with me during the first two weeks of class. All discussions will remain confidential. Students with disabilities will also need to contact the Student Disability Access Office.
