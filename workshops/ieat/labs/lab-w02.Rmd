# Introduction

This is your first reproducible report! The top section of this file between the `---` lines is the YAML metadata where you can change the document preferences. Go to [RStudio's website](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/formats.html) to learn about different output formats and templates.

# Importing Data

## Download to machine

The data files we want to import are sitting on Dropbox. We could import directly into the R session, but let's first download the files to your project directory and then load into R. The loading step will teach you how read in files from your local machine.

The following code chunk will download the files. 
* Replace `input` with the name of the folder where you want to store raw data. 
* Run this code chunk once. Once you run it successfully, replace `{r}` with `{r, eval=FALSE}` to prevent R from trying to download the files over and over again.

```{r download}
  download.file("https://www.dropbox.com/s/k4d2j6feayezkun/r2d2.csv?dl=1", 
                destfile = "input/r2d2-w02.csv")
  download.file("https://www.dropbox.com/s/1e2tqqmfzmzaybe/r2d2.dta?dl=1", 
                destfile = "input/r2d2-w02.dta")
  download.file("https://www.dropbox.com/s/6b8t2c877yvqeax/r2d2.rds?dl=1", 
                destfile = "input/r2d2-w02.rds")
  download.file("https://www.dropbox.com/s/beftqecfs4vvuss/r2d2.sas?dl=1", 
                destfile = "input/r2d2-w02.sas")
  download.file("https://www.dropbox.com/s/tiqgit23db2fk8x/r2d2.txt?dl=1", 
                destfile = "input/r2d2-w02.text")
  download.file("https://www.dropbox.com/s/7a3i7e0bfmqiikr/r2d2.xlsx?dl=1", 
                destfile = "input/r2d2-w02.xlsx")
```

```{r loadCSV}
  
```
