<h1><span class="header-section-number">7</span> Duck, Duck, Research Participant</h1>
<p>Now that you have a good, evidence-based research question and a primary outcome that you can define and measure, you are ready to think about the subjects of your research. Most often your research subjects—participants—will be people or places. You have two basic questions to answer about these participants:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>How will you find, recruit, and select them? (sampling)</li>
<li>How many do you need to include to meet your study objectives? (power)</li>
</ol>
<p>We’ll tackle both questions in this chapter.</p>
<hr />
<p>There are two general approaches to sampling: probability and non-probability sampling. The main difference is that in a probability sample, every unit (e.g., person) in the population has a knowable, non-zero probability of selection. Most research in global health does NOT use probability sampling.<a href="references.html#fn54" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> There’s a good chance that you won’t either, unless you’re trying to accurately estimate some characteristic of the population. For instance, you want to estimate the prevalence of depression among pregnant women in Thailand. To get an unbiased answer to this question, you’ll need a probability sample. These types of epidemiological/descriptive questions are critical, of course, but most research examines the relationships between variables rather than prevalence, and probability samples are not essential.</p>
<div id="probability-sampling" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.1</span> Probability Sampling</h2>
<p>While you may not ever have a need to organize a probability sample, it’s important to know the mechanics since you will consume and evaluate descriptive research. In global health, the most common application of probability sampling comes from nationally representative surveys like the DHS, which we discovered in Chapter 1. The sampling strategy in a DHS survey is complex, so we will come to it in a moment. First, let’s review basic principles and approaches.</p>
<div id="sampling-error" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Sampling error</h3>
<p>Returning to an example from Chapter 1, insecticide treated nets (ITNs) can prevent malaria transmission and save lives, especially the lives of young children living in endemic regions. So a policymaker in a country like Kenya, with its high rates of malaria, might want to know what percentage of her country’s more than 7 million children younger than 5 years of age sleep under an ITN.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the unreasonable and assume that we’re able to survey every caregiver about every child and that we do so without any measurement bias.<a href="references.html#fn55" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> If this were possible, the results would reflect the “true” level of ITN use among the <strong>population</strong> of more than 7 million Kenyan children under the age of 5.</p>
<p>This would of course be nearly impossible to do in practice, but more importantly, it would be completely unnecessary. Rather than try to survey everyone, we can recruit a <strong>representative</strong> sample—a subset of the population that reflects the population.</p>
<p>This subset, however, will not be a perfect reflection of the population. Of course the closer our sample gets in size to the population, the more it will reflect the population, but it will always be imperfect because of <strong>sampling error</strong>. This is because our sample, however we obtain it, is just one possible draw of all possible samples. Whether the sample is 0.09% of the population or 90% of the population, it is still one possible subset of all possible subsets. Both the 0.09% and 90% samples will produce results that differ from each other and the population.</p>
<p>For instance, let’s imagine that we have a population of 40,000 adults ages 18 to 65. We want to estimate some characteristic of the population, so we plan to survey a sample of 100 people. For the sake of this example, we’ll assume that we can randomly select 100 people from the population, so everyone has a 100/40000 chance of being selected. The image below shows three possible draws of 100 people from this population.</p>
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:sampselect"></span>
<img src="images/sampselect.png" alt="Three possible draws from the population. Each circle in this illustration represents a person, and the circles are different sizes and colors to remind us that our population is made up of different types of people."  />
<p class="caption">
Figure 7.1: Three possible draws from the population. Each circle in this illustration represents a person, and the circles are different sizes and colors to remind us that our population is made up of different types of people.
</p>
</div>
<p>Each draw from the population is unique, but they are alike in the fact that each sample is subject to sampling error because it is not a perfect reflection of the population. <strong>We can’t know the true population mean in reality</strong>, but let’s break the rules and assume that we can for this example. As shown in the generic example below, the “true” population mean is 100. Notice how each sample of 100 is slightly wrong, with means of 99.0, 99.6, and 97.5 from left to right. This is sampling error in action. Just by chance all of the means are below 100.</p>
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:samples3"></span>
<img src="images/samples3.png" alt="Histograms of the 100 data points in each sample and the sample means showing sampling error relative to the population."  />
<p class="caption">
Figure 7.2: Histograms of the 100 data points in each sample and the sample means showing sampling error relative to the population.
</p>
</div>
<p>In practice, we would only ever get one draw from the population. One study, one sample. If our study happened to draw the sample on the far left (A), our estimate of the sample mean ({<span class="math">\[}\bar{x}{/\]</span>}) would be 99.0. We call this a point estimate. It’s our study result. If we had drawn a different sample, we would have obtained a slightly different estimate of the mean.</p>
<p>The next image tries to drive this point home. Imagine that we could sample 100 people from the population over and over again. 10,000 times for good measure. Each of these samples would have an estimate of the mean. The next image shows the distribution of these sample means. In other words, we draw 10,000 samples, calculate the mean for each sample, and plot a histogram of all 10,000 means. As you can see, the means of samples A, B, and C from the previous figure make an appearance in this distribution.</p>
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:sdsm"></span>
<img src="images/sdsmwindow.png" alt="Sampling distribution for the sample mean. Histogram of the means of 10,000 random samples."  />
<p class="caption">
Figure 7.3: Sampling distribution for the sample mean. Histogram of the means of 10,000 random samples.
</p>
</div>
<p>If the “true” population mean—again, something we never get to know—is 100, then we see that all 10,000 sample means shown in the figure above get us pretty close. But we don’t escape sampling error.</p>
<p>Don’t despair.</p>
<p>The beauty of a probability sample is that we can take the mean and standard deviation of our one study sample and quantify the difference between our sample and the <em>expected</em> population. We call this quantity the <strong>error of estimation</strong>, or the <strong>margin of error</strong>. We can calculate the margin of error for our sample with the following formula: 1.96*standard error.</p>
<p>1.96 is a critical value related to our desire to construct a 95% confidence interval. The standard error of the sample mean is the sample standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.</p>
<p>For Sample A, the standard deviation is 9.1 and the sample size is 100, so the standard error is 0.908. This means that the margin of error is <code>1.96*0.908</code>, or ± 1.8. With a sample mean of 99.0 for Sample A, this translates to a 95% confidence interval of 97.2 to 100.8. Informally, we could say that we are 95% confident that the “true” population mean falls between 97.2 and 100.8. The width of this confidence interval gives us a sense of the plausible range of values<a href="references.html#fn56" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> and thus how closely our sample reflects the population. Naturally, we want our confidence intervals to be narrow but it is important to remember that they may, by chance, be centered on a value that is far away from the population mean. The challenge is that you never know if the CI you calculated from your data are close or far from the truth. The good news is that if the confidence interval is narrow, you should at least feel better about any inference you make than if it is wide. We’ll discuss how to shrink this interval in the next chapter.</p>
<p>Before moving on to a discussion of approaches to probability sampling, it’s important to note that it is possible to calculate a margin of error on data collected from a non-probability sample—your calculator will not protest—but the result will not be reliable, and therefore not meaningful, because our statistical methods assume probability sampling. So if anyone asks you about how to recruit a sample to estimate the prevalence of a disorder in a population, you can tell them that THE RIGHT WAY™ is to use probability sampling. Here’s how.</p>

<div id="approaches-1" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Approaches</h3>
<div id="simple-random-sampling" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Simple random sampling</h4>
<p>The easiest method of creating a probability sample is a lottery in which every unit has an equal chance of being selected. This is just like pulling slips of paper from a hat; the slips of paper we pull out make up our <strong>simple random sample</strong>.</p>
<p>The challenge with this approach is that our hat must contain a slip of paper for every eligible participant from the population. In other words, we need a <strong>sampling frame</strong> or a master list of all members of the population.</p>
<p>If the population is narrowly defined, such registered primary care nurses in District A of Country Z, it’s possible that we could obtain a list of all 400 registered nurses, let’s say, put their names in a hat, and pull 30 names at random.<a href="references.html#fn57" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> This would be a probability sample, and we could quantify our confidence that the sample reflects the population of nurses. We can’t definitively claim that our results generalize to all nurses in Country Z, but that might not be our goal in the first place.</p>
<p>In most cases, however, we don’t have sampling frames that are suitable for answering our research questions. Therefore, simple is impossible.</p>

Moss et al. (2011) looked to space to solve the sampling frame problem in Southern Province, Zambia.<a href="references.html#fn58" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> The team used remote sensing (satellite images of the area) to construct a sampling frame of households, and then selected 128 to participate in the study.

<div id="systematic-sampling" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Systematic sampling</h4>
<p>If you don’t have a sampling frame at the outset, you can sometimes use <strong>systematic sampling</strong> to randomly select participants on the fly. For instance, we might want to know something about the women who attend antenatal care services at a clinic or network of clinics. Of course we don’t know who will become pregnant and seek care until they appear at the clinic, so we don’t start the study with a sampling frame.</p>
<p>Instead of randomly selecting women from a list, we can decide to invite every Nth woman to participate and continue until we hit our target sample size. This is what Oyibo et al. (2011) did in Ebonyi State, South Eastern Nigeria.<a href="references.html#fn59" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> They wanted a sample size of 208 participants, so they invited every 5th pregnant woman who came to a particular health clinic to participate in the study. This meant that they had to wait for 1,040 women to pass through the clinic; 1 invitation for every 5 women.<a href="references.html#fn60" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>

<h4>Stratified random sampling</h4>
<p>A twist on simple random sampling is to group like units into <strong>strata</strong> (a.k.a. different hats) and randomly select from within each stratum. This is important if we want to compare subgroups, such as single mothers and women from two parent households. If we randomly sample from one big pool, we might not get enough units from each group by chance. This is more likely when some groups have fewer units in the population. If there a small number of single mothers in the population, for instance, simple randomization might not produce a sample with enough single mothers to enable a comparison.</p>
<p>In this example of <strong>stratified random sampling</strong>, we have two strata—single mothers and women from two parent households—and randomly select from each stratum in equal proportions to facilitate the comparison. Alternatively, we could prioritize the need to be representative and randomly select a number of women from each stratum in proportion to the size of the stratum. In other words, if there are fewer single mothers in the population, we select fewer participants from the single mother stratum. This method of <strong>proportional sampling</strong> would help to ensure a representative sample.<a href="references.html#fn61" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> A side effect is that we might end up with too few single mothers to enable a between-groups comparison, but that might not be our primary objective.</p>

Hypertension in West Africa:
</p>
<p>
Cappuccio et al. (2004) conducted a study in Ashanti, West Africa to assess the prevalence of hypertension among men and women.<a href="references.html#fn62" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> They identified 12 villages (6 semiurban and 6 rural) and conducted a population census in each village over the course of three months. The authors then invited a stratified random sample of 1,896 adults aged 40 to 75 years to participate. The sample was stratified by village and then age and sex within each village to reflect the population structure determined by the village census.

<h4>Cluster and multistage sampling</h4>
<p>So far we’ve been discussing relatively small populations where it is possible to develop a sampling frame. But what if we want to think big, such as a study to estimate the prevalence of ITN use among children under 5 years of age in Kenya? To recruit a nationally representative sample, we would need to use a combination of cluster and multistage sampling.</p>
<div id="cluster-sampling" class="section level5 unnumbered">
<h5>Cluster sampling</h5>
<p>The first step in cluster sampling is to identify groups of people—clusters—such as administrative units like districts or counties. Next, rather than randomly selecting people into the sample directly,<a href="references.html#fn63" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> we first randomly select clusters. So if there are 100 clusters, we might select 10. Then in each of the 10 clusters, we obtain lists of people (sampling frame). If we select 50 people from each cluster, that’s a total sample size of 500. To make things simple, let’s assume there are exactly 2000 eligible people in each cluster. In that case, each person selected would have a probability of selection of <code>10/100 * 50/2000 = 0.0025</code>.</p>
<p>This is an easier approach than simple randomization because we don’t need a master sampling frame of individuals that covers all 100 clusters. But it’s still not reasonable in many cases because we need a sampling frame for the clusters we do select. Many developing countries lack phone books and address registries, so developing a sampling frame form scratch can be a big hassle, or worse—mission impossible.</p>
</div>
<div id="multistage-sampling" class="section level5 unnumbered">
<h5>Multistage sampling</h5>
<p>To make life easier, researchers often employ multistage sampling in conjunction with cluster sampling. Clusters can take various forms, but administrative units are popular choices. Scanning right to left, we see how communities in Uganda are nested in parishes, which are nested in subcounties, inside districts, and ultimately inside sub-national regions.</p>
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:nest"></span>

<p class="caption">
Figure 7.5: Nesting of clusters
</p>
</div>
<p>In a <strong>multistage cluster sample</strong>, the idea is to select samples of clusters in stages so that the burden of developing a sample frame at the lowest level is minimized. At each stage there is a probability of selection that can ultimately be applied to individuals, if individuals are the lowest unit of selection.</p>
<p>Here’s an example from Uganda. As part of an exercise with UNICEF to estimate the national coverage of programs for adolescents, we conducted a multistage cluster sample that began at the level of districts. At the time this work was conducted, there were 120 districts in Uganda. We randomly selected 40 of these 120 districts from within 6 regional strata; the number of districts selected from each stratum was proportional to the population size of the stratum.</p>
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:ug"></span>
<img src="images/ugandaclusters.jpg" alt="Example multistage cluster sample"  />
<p class="caption">
Figure 7.6: Example multistage cluster sample
</p>
</div>
<p>Then within each of the 40 districts, we randomly selected 3 sub-counties. The number of subcounties per district varied; the figure shows 6 subcounties in the example district highlighted in red. Within each subcounty, we organized a data collection effort to enumerate (list) all adolescent programs that fit a set of criteria, and then we randomly selected 5 programs from this list to visit. In the end, each enumerated program had a known probability of selection: <code>40/120 * 3/subcounties * 5/programs</code>.</p>

Kenya 2008-09 DHS:
</p>
<p>
DHS surveys are a great example of the multistage cluster sampling approach. Let’s take a look at the <a href="http://dhsprogram.com/publications/publication-fr229-dhs-final-reports.cfm">2008-09 Kenya DHS</a> (KDHS) report.
</p>
<p>
The sample for the 2008-09 KDHS included nearly 10,000 households, enough to be representative at the national and provincial levels, as well as urban and rural settings. “Representative” used in this context means that the estimates are unbiased because of probability sampling AND that the sample size is large enough to enable disaggregation to lower levels including provinces and setting (urban vs rural). The sample size is not large enough, however, to permit valid estimates at even lower levels, like counties.<a href="references.html#fn64" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
The KDHS sample is a multistage cluster sample. In the first stage, 400 clusters (133 urban and 267 rural) were randomly selected from a master sampling frame of clusters. In the second stage, a team of enumerators updated lists of households in each selected cluster and randomly sampled 25 households from this list.
</p>
<p>
Within each selected household, any females age 15-49 years who were living in the dwelling or visiting the night before the survey could be selected. A total of 8,767 women were eligible to participate, and the response rate was 96.3%. The selection of male participants (age 15-54) was via systematic random sampling of every second household; 3,910 men were eligible and 88.6% participated.
</p>
<p>
Since the KDHS is a probability sample, it’s possible to estimate the sampling error at the national and provincial levels, as well as by urban and rural settings. For instance, the survey found that 25.5% of currently married women have an <a href="http://dhsprogram.com/topics/Unmet-Need.cfm">unmet need</a> for family planning (meaning they want to delay or prevent pregnancy, but are not using contraception). The standard error of this estimate was 0.008, so the 95% confidence interval (± 2*0.008) ranged from 24.0% to 27.2%.

<div id="non-probability-sampling" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> Non-Probability Sampling</h2>
<p>In many cases probability sampling is not possible or feasible. The alternative is to recruit a non-probability sample. The downside is that it’s not possible to estimate how closely the sample reflects the population without probability sampling, but this is only a limitation if the goal is to characterize the larger population.</p>
<div id="approaches-2" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Approaches</h3>
<div id="convenience-sampling" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Convenience sampling</h4>
<p><strong>Convenience samples</strong> are convenient for us as researchers. If you have ever participated in a research study on a college campus, you were probably part of a convenience sample of available undergraduates. Without convenience samples, there would be little research to publish in psychology.</p>
<p>Convenience samples are not suited for precisely estimating some characteristic of the population, but most research does not aim to do this. Most research looks at the relationship between variables. For instance, is there a relationship between sleeping under a mosquito net and household income? To answer this question, we could recruit a convenience sample of households in a particular community and ask them about their bed net ownership and use, as well as their monthly income or consumption. Our results would not be nationally representative, but they would tell us something about potential associations.</p>
<p>It might be possible (and not cost prohibitive) to conduct the same study with a probability sample; for instance, if the population of households is small enough, we might be able to create a sampling frame for the entire community or for selected clusters. In the end, however, the results would still not be nationally representative—just community representative. This could be a good thing and worth doing if feasible. It’s just not essential to answer the correlational research question.</p>
<p>The bigger question is whether the results from this one study tell us something larger about the relationship between bed net use and socioeconomic status. <strong>Do the results generalize to other places and faces?</strong></p>
<p>Make no mistake: this is a valid question for both the small study with a convenience sample and the small study with a probability sample that is representative of the community. In both cases, reviewers will ask whether the findings are applicable to other contexts. The only good way to answer this question is to conduct additional studies in new contexts.</p>
</div>
<div id="purposive-sampling" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Purposive sampling</h4>
<p>Whereas a convenience sample is “convenient” because it targets easily available people (or other units), a <strong>purposive sample</strong> is “purposeful” because the researcher sets out to include certain types of people (or other units). For instance, we might want to examine the training practices of physicians in Brazil, so we find a group of recent medical school graduates and ask them about their experience in school. It might be possible to carry out the same study with a probability sample, in which case we could estimate our confidence that the results are representative of medical schools in Brazil.</p>
</div>
<div id="quota-sampling" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Quota sampling</h4>
<p>If group comparisons are important and a probability sample is not possible, a <strong>quota sample</strong> might be a good choice. This is a type of convenience or purposive sample that ensures the sample contains a set number or percentage of certain types of units. In the household survey example about bed net use, we might choose to recruit a convenience sample that consists of half single-parent households and half two-parent households.</p>

Snowball sampling and respondent driven sampling:
</p>
<p>
Snowball sampling is a type of purposive sampling that is often used to sample hard to reach populations, such as people who engage in illegal behaviors, like drug users. In this technique, the initial participants (seeds) refer acquaintances to join the study. These new participants do the same, and the sample “snowballs” from there.
</p>
<p>
Some researchers believe that a variant of this approach called respondent driven sampling can produce unbiased estimates of the population in certain instances.<a href="references.html#fn65" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> The process of recruitment looks similar to the snowball approach. The key difference comes in the analysis phase; participants’ social network data and the recruitment patterns are used to adjust the estimates and confidence intervals.
